![Design preview for the NFT preview card component coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) for this challenge !

## The challenge

This is my take on this challenge.
Using only HTML and CSS, specifically flex layout to achieve this result.
This overlay solution was very interesting, good to know!

## I'm not perfect

I'm a beginner, so I might not have all the best practice and, yes, still learning AND improving :blush:

## Feedbacks are welcome ! ðŸš€

Feel free to give me any feedback, they're always welcome.
